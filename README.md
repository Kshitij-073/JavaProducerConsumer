# JavaProducerConsumer
The classic Producer Consumer problem where Producer should not produce if the list is full and the consumer should not consume
if the list is empty along with synchronisation between the two operations . Implemented using 'BlockingQueue' where the class
itself takes care of list being empty and full conditions
